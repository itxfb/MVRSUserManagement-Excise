# Motor Vehicle Registration System - Excise and Taxation Department of Pakistan

The Motor Vehicle Registration System, managed by the Excise and Taxation Department of Pakistan, is a robust and secure platform designed to handle the registration of motor vehicles. This comprehensive system incorporates a multitude of security standards and advanced technologies to ensure data integrity, user control, and efficient operations.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **Ocelot API Gateway**: The Ocelot API Gateway ensures controlled access to the system, routing requests securely to appropriate microservices and enforcing authorization rules.

- **RabbitMQ Message Broker**: RabbitMQ facilitates reliable communication between different components of the system through asynchronous message queuing.

- **SMTP Mailing Services**: SMTP integration enables the system to send email notifications and alerts efficiently.

- **Security Standards**: The system employs multiple security standards, including Two-Step Verification, OTP Verification, and JWT-based stateless authorization to safeguard user data and system integrity.

- **CI/CD with GitLab**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitLab ensure a streamlined development process while minimizing production interference.

- **Microservices Architecture with Docker**: Microservices are orchestrated within Docker containers, allowing for easy deployment, scaling, and management of different components.

- **gRPC for Streamlined Communication**: gRPC is utilized for efficient communication between services, enabling different requests to be handled through a single stream of communication.

- **Angular 13 Front-End**: The front-end is built using Angular 13, implementing custom validators and interceptors for enhanced security and data validation.

- **JWT Stateless Authorization**: Complete JWT-based stateless authorization is implemented on the backend, with JWT tokens passing through the Ocelot Gateway for access control.

- **Optimized Performance**: Performance is optimized by using Server-Side Grids in SQL for efficient data retrieval and Lazy Loading strategy in Angular for enhanced front-end responsiveness.
